Comments by Dave Beale </p>

<p>I want to welcome all of you
freshman to Parks House. You are entering one of the best places to live on
this campus. Most of the university, as you no doubt know by now, is an
impersonal bureaucracy. The one place where all of you will have a chance to
be known and to know others is the dormitory. If you give it a chance, Parks
House can give you the feeling of belonging that nearly everyone needs. The
men here have always been friendly and helpful. We try to eat together and
discuss whatever is on our minds, which is most anything. You will meet
interesting, intelligent people who can add greatly to your education. All
you have to do is co-operate with your neighbors and participate in whatever
interests you </p>

<p>You may have heard rumors that
I also act as a policeman. Well -- it is partly true. I don't like trying to
catch people violating rules, but when someone becomes a disruptive in-

<p>May I be one of the first to
welcome you to Indiana University and Parks House. Most of you are here for
the first time and college life will present the greatest challenge of your
life. We the officers of this house wish you the best of luck in your
courses. Our job is to promote the conditions which will improve your grades
and further your education. </p>

<p>These are two separate goals--
they are not the same. We help to improve your grades through enforced quiet
hours, a test file which rivals those of fraternities, and by the experienced
upper classman who will make every effort to help you with classes when
possible. To further your education we present programs which will add to
your knowledge of the other disciplines besides the ones you will study in
class. During the first and second semesters you will have the chance to eat
dinner with many professors and lecturers of this college, many (Continued on

<p>TEAM WORK </p>

<p>The entire code of independent
living is based on teamwork. In order for the Men of Parks to get the most
out of their year here, it is very necessary that we all work together.
Suppost the house, both athletically, academically and socially. Take an
active part in the house activity that mosts interests you. If their is a
phase of some program that you feel is not represented, sep out and let it be
known. Keep in touch with your floor representative; he's your representative
in the House Assembly. The variety of programs in Parks this year is probably
the fineast offered in the past five years here. </p>

<p>House unity is of the greatest
imporatnce. Each of you has a special field in which you have excelled, and
it should be in this activity that you can help the house and get a great
deal of personal satisfaction from participating. The returning upperclassmen
have worked very hard in preparation for this year, planning out a very
varied program that they hope will cover the likes of the majority of the
freshmen. </p>

<p>Parks House has always been
one of the leading units in the Quad and this year should be no exception.
But it's all up to the incoming fresmen to continue Parks along the fine
traditions of the past. Let's all chip in and make OUR unit No.1 in the quad
and No. 1 for you. Remember, you'll only get out of the huse what you make it
and this year's potential is the greatest of the past five. Let's make this
"Parks House Year." </p>

<p>EDITOR'S STATEMENT </p>

<p>The Parks House Scribe in now
in its eighth year of existence and it boasts a tradition of excellence
unsurpassed by any other unit newspaper on campus. Year after year the Scribe
monopolizes top honors at the Quad awards banquet and it is distributed to
and read by many student and faculty leaders at I.U. But the Scribe is not a
campus newspaper; it is YOUR project. The entire paper is written, edited,
and published by the Men of the House, and we are proud of it. The Scribe is
your news media, and you are encouraged to use it frequently. In the past,
the staff of the Scribe has followed a very liberal editorial policy, and
this will be continued in the future; NO ARTICLES SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION
WILL BE REJECTED. Each year, the staff of the Scribe strives not only to
maintain the quality and freshness of the paper, but to improve it.
</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or
would like to help out with the publication of the Scribe in any way, feel
free to contact me in room 314. </p>

<p>PAGE 3.. THE SCRIBE..
SEPTEMBER 11, 1967 </p>

<p>BOB ZSDANYI: EDITOR EMERITUS
</p>

<p>Last Spring, Bob Zsadanyi
picked up a softball for the first time in his life, papped it against the
wall a few times, decided that he would like to play the game himself, and
went out to lead the Parks House team to a successful season as our pitcher.
Under the circumstances, this was a most remarkable accomplishment.
</p>

<p>Even mor fantastic, though,
were Bob's successes with the PARKS HOUSE SCRIBE. Just as in softball, Bob
had never worked with a newspaper until he became editor of the SCRIBE. For
one and a half years Bob served as the top man on the SCRIBE staff, giving
the same care to each issue as one would give to an important paper for each
of his classes. Under Bob's leadership, the staff of the paper nearly
doubled, and the content of the articles and general appearance of the
newspaper itself improved considerably. </p>

<p>As editor, Bob had the house
artist design a new House Crest which appears on the front page of this
issue. Also, Bob led the paper to two "Outstanding Quad Newspaper" Awards.
</p>

<p>In light of his past services,
and in anticipation of the help he will be giving to the SCRIBE in the
future, it is with great appreciation that the 1967-68 SCRIBE staff
officially confers Bob with the title of Editor Emeritus, with the
publication of this issue </p>

<p>Bob is a senior, majoring in
Geography, and he resides in Burlington, Ontario. </p>

<p>________________ </p>

<p>OUR FACULTY ASSOCIATE Thomas
F. Barton, Professor of Geography, joined the faculty in 1947. He spent two
years in Thailand at the College of Education of Thailand. Since 1950 he has
been editor of the Journal Of Geography. He has written numerous articles on
Education, Conservation, and Urban Development. </p>

<p>He has been with Parks House
as Faculty Associate for a good number of years. The men of the house have
always had the greatest respect for him. he (sic) is always concerned about
the the house even though he is a very busy man. His name has appeared
through the entire history of the SCRIBE and pictures and letters of his own
are preserved in the scrapbook. </p>

<p>Parks is one of the very few
houses in the Quad that has a faculty associate and the only one that has had
so long standing a relationship. Last year the house realized what a great
debt they owed Dr. Barton and on May 19, dedicated the Parks Lounge to him.
It is now called the Dr. Thomas F. Barton Lounge. </p>

<p>The Dr., even though he is on
sabatical this semester, will be down to visit us and talk to the men as
usual. Such an act shows just how great a man he is. Be sure to get up and
talk to him when he comes. </p>

<p>_________ </p>

<p>COUNSELOR'S COMMENTS
</p>

<p>(Cont'd.)... flence I have
little choice but to take disciplinary action. As long as you show respect
for the rights and welfare of others in the house, you will have no trouble
from me. </p>

<p>I hope that all of you will
act in the responsible, self-disciplined manner that has become a tradition
in Parks House. I will assume that you are capable of taking care of
yourselves. I hope that I am right. If so, I will be happier and you will
have a far better chance of success in your college life. </p>

<p>IN THE TROPHY CASE </p>

<p>In the past, Parks has always
been the leader in the Quad and this year, with your enthusiasm we plan to
continue in this fine tradition. Some of the awards of the past six years are
the following: {Note: These were in a vertical list on the page} Outstanding
Unit 1961, Outstanding Unit 1962, Outstanding Unit 1963, Most Improved House
1960, Community Service Award 1961, Community Service Award 1967, Outstanding
Governor 1961, All Sports Trophy (2nd) 1962, Track and Field (1st Ind.) 1966,
Track and Field (3rd) 1966, Little 500 (8th) 1964, Homecoming (2nd Ind.)
1966, Homecoming (2nd Overall) 1966, Homecoming (1st Quad) 1966, Best
Newspaper 1961, Best Newspaper 1963, Best Newspaper 1964, Best Newspaper
1965, Best Newspaper 1966, Best Newspaper 1967, ... A quick tour of the other
unit lounges will quickly reveal that Parks leads in House spirit by a wide
margin. Let's add a few more awards to the list this year. Outstanding Unit
would be a nice start! </p>

<p>________________ </p>

<p>GOVERNOR'S GAVEL (Cont'd)
</p>

<p>of whom may be your own
instructors. To start out, you will meet Dr. Barton, our faculty associate,
this week. Campus groups, controversial and otherwise, will be invited to
speak in our lounge. You will have the unique chance to really LEARN on you
own. </p>

<p>For those of you who have
lasted through my article to this point, I will now give you the facts (of
life) about our social activities (viewed by many as the best part of the
overall program -- of course all of you will prefer the academic program! ! ?
?). There will be tournaments on the quad and campus level in almost every
sport imaginable. The House itself sponsers parties for specific occasions
and often we get together in the lounge to listen to the championship fights
or informal discussions. </p>

<p>Now, if you noticed, I have
neglected the topic of--GIRLS. Don't ever think that I would forget them. We
will start the semester with an exchang dinner either this week or next and I
am sure that if you like them (girls) we will have exchange and date dinners
as often as every two weeks. And if you can't make a hit with the girls, then
there is no need to worry; because, Parks House has the great asset of Mike
Stump--President of Wright Quad. He can fix you up with a date and I assure
you that she will be a winner. </p>

<p>In closing, let me just say
that this is a "Parks House Year". I have known this since last Spring.
Within the next week I will have met all of you and you will know the "whys"
and "hows" of this House government. I know all of you will want to attend
the first House meeting of this semester to hear about everything we have
planned. Above all, remember that this is your house and you will make it a
success or failure. Officers can provide all the leadership in the world, but
without the people to help us we are nothing. </p>

<p>GRENADIERS HONORED AT BANQUET

<p>__________ ________ </p>

<p>REUNION HELD IN LOUISVILLE
</p>

<p>Toward the end of May in Parks
House when not occupied with too much worry over finals, many Grenadiers are
talking about and making their summer plans, and by the end of August are
wondering why those plans fell through. Several Parks House Men, however, had
the initiative to finish one project that had been planned for several
months: the Parks House reunion. </p>

<p>Steve ("Bo") Sample organized
the affair, making arrangements for the party to stay at the Albert Pick
motel in Louisville. Having mailed out several questionaires, sets of plans,
and maps, Bo decided that July 28-31 was the best date for the event. He
invited everyone in Parks House. </p>

<p>Joe Fiscel, Barry Gangi, Steve
Harrison, Bob McCorkle, Hal Moore, Larry Rose, Jim Stemler, and Bo were the
fun-seeking Grenadiers who invaded Louisville. ____ </p>
